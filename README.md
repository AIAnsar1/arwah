# Arwah - Unified Network Security Tool

Arwah is a powerful, unified network security tool that combines the functionality of RustScan (port scanning) and Sniffglue (packet analysis) into a single, efficient Rust application.

## Features

### ðŸš€ Port Scanning (RustScan Integration)
- **Ultra-fast port scanning** with customizable batch sizes
- **Multi-threaded scanning** for maximum performance  
- **Script integration** for automated vulnerability assessment
- **Flexible target specification** (IPs, ranges, hostnames)
- **Greppable output** for easy integration with other tools

### ðŸ“¡ Packet Analysis (Sniffglue Integration)  
- **Real-time packet capture** and analysis
- **Multi-protocol support** (TCP, UDP, HTTP, TLS, DNS, DHCP, etc.)
- **Multiple output formats** (compact, debugging, JSON)
- **Multi-threaded packet processing**
- **PCAP file analysis** support

### ðŸ”§ Unified Interface
- **Single binary** for both scanning and sniffing
- **Flexible command structure** with subcommands
- **Combined mode** for comprehensive network analysis
- **Consistent configuration** across all features

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/your-org/arwah.git
cd arwah
cargo build --release

# The binary will be available at target/release/arwah
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Port scanning
arwah scan -a 192.168.1.1

# Packet sniffing  
arwah sniff

# Combined mode (scan then sniff)
arwah --both

# Help for specific modes
arwah scan --help
arwah sniff --help
```

## Usage Modes

### 1. Port Scanning Mode

```bash
# Scan a single IP
arwah scan -a 192.168.1.1

# Scan multiple IPs
arwah scan -a 192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2,192.168.1.3

# Scan a subnet
arwah scan -a 192.168.1.0/24

# Scan specific ports
arwah scan -a 192.168.1.1 -p 22,80,443

# Scan port range
arwah scan -a 192.168.1.1 -p 1-1000

# Fast scan with custom batch size
arwah scan -a 192.168.1.1 -b 5000 -t 1000

# Run with scripts
arwah scan -a 192.168.1.1 -s default
```

### 2. Packet Sniffing Mode

```bash
# Listen on default interface
arwah sniff

# Listen on specific interface
arwah sniff -i eth0

# Read from pcap file
arwah sniff -r capture.pcap

# JSON output for automation
arwah sniff --json

# Verbose debugging output
arwah sniff --debugging -v 4

# Multi-threaded processing
arwah sniff --threads 8
```

### 3. Combined Mode

```bash
# Run both scan and sniff sequentially
arwah --both

# This will:
# 1. Perform port scan with default settings
# 2. Start packet capture after scan completes
```

## Configuration

Create a configuration file at `~/.config/arwah/config.toml`:

```toml
[scan]
batch_size = 3000
timeout = 3000
greppable = false

[sniff]
verbose = 2
threads = 4
json = false

[security]
disable_seccomp = false
```

See `arwah.example.toml` for a complete configuration example.

## Output Formats

### Scanning Output
```bash
# Standard format
192.168.1.1 -> [22,80,443]

# Greppable format (--greppable)
192.168.1.1:22
192.168.1.1:80  
192.168.1.1:443
```

### Sniffing Output
```bash
# Compact format (default)
[tcp/SA] 192.168.1.100:54321 -> 93.184.216.34:80 [http] GET / HTTP/1.1

# JSON format (--json)
{"timestamp":"2024-01-01T12:00:00Z","protocol":"tcp","src":"192.168.1.100:54321","dst":"93.184.216.34:80","data":"..."}

# Debug format (--debugging)  
IPv4: Ipv4Header { ... }
  TCP: TcpHeader { ... }
    HTTP: GET / HTTP/1.1 ...
```

## Advanced Features

### Script Integration
```bash
# Run Nmap scripts after port discovery
arwah scan -a target.com -s default

# Custom script execution
arwah scan -a target.com -s custom --command "nmap -sV"
```

### Performance Tuning
```bash
# High-speed scanning
arwah scan -a 192.168.1.0/24 -b 10000 --ulimit 10000

# Multi-threaded packet processing
arwah sniff --threads 16 -v 1
```

### Security Features
```bash
# Run in sandbox mode (default)
arwah sniff

# Disable seccomp for compatibility (not recommended)
arwah sniff --insecure-disable-seccomp
```

## Requirements

- **Rust 1.70+** for building
- **Root privileges** for packet capture
- **Linux/macOS/Windows** support
- **libpcap** for packet capture functionality
